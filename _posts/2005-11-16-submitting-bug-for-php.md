There will surely be the time where you find a bug in PHP, but prior
submitting half hearted bug report make sure you've accomplished the following
things:

  * [search the bug tracker](http://bugs.php.net/search.php) if the bug has already been subbmitted
  * put together a short and behaviour reproducing script
  * verify the behaviour with the **latest** version AKA [snap](http://snaps.php.net) of PHP
  * if PHP crashes, [generate a backtrace](http://bugs.php.net/bugs-generating-backtrace.php)

If you're in doubt, read [this](http://bugs.php.net/how-to-report.php) if you
didn't already (which you shouldn't tell anyone by the way).
