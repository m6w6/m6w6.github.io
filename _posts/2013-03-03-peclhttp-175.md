[pecl_http-1.7.5](http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http/1.7.5) has been
released today.

Nearly a year and 170k downloads after the last release (1.7.4 was released
April 2nd 2012).  
  
It fixes a single bug:  

  * [Bug #64310](http://bugs.php.net/64310) (weak etags W/"abc" are quoted as "W/"abc"")


The same user (thanks Niko), discovered a peculiarity of libcurl:

  * If you utilize libcurl's _TIMECOND_ feature through pecl_http's _lastmodified_ request option, 
    libcurl ignores response bodies from servers that do not closely follow the RFC and send a _200 OK_  
    response instead of a _304 Not Modified_  when the condition is unmet.

Slightly more background information is available at the relevant [bug
report](http://bugs.php.net/64298).


Please leave a comment, if you have an opinion about which component's
behavior is arguable here.
