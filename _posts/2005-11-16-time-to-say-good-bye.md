Yeah, it may come suddenly, but it's time to say good bye to curly braces used
as string indexing operator.

PHP-5.1 will issue an E_STRICT error, and PHP-6 will probably don't know this
syntax any more.

I don't know why, but I've got some strange sentimental feelings :-) , maybe
because I've never used those other brackets for string indexing...

So, beloved, I already miss you! :'(
