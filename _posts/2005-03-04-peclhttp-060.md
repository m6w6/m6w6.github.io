I just released [pecl_http](http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http/) 0.6.0! ;)

For its current capabilities you should have a look at
[this](http://dev.iworks.at/ext-http/http-functions.html.gz) document.

Don't hesitate to leave a comment, or drop [me](mailto:mike@php.net) a mail if
you've got questions!
