While some of the core PHP internals already see theirself that there's
something wrong with the so-called generic way ZE2 looks up classes, many
stolidly ignore the claims of PHP users...

Look at this [MARC Thread](http://marc.info/?t=111887022700001&r=1&w=2) and that
[MARC Thread](http://marc.info/?t=111999411200002&r=1&w=2).

[Now something to laugh (or cry) at](http://marc.info/?l=pear-cvs&m=111999141214948&w=2)

WTF?
