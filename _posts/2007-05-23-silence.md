It's been [more than 3 months](http://blog.iworks.at/?/archives/50-HTTP,-CURL-and-stuff.html) 
that I brought back to mind, what was happening in my PHP/HTTP/CURL world, so here we go.

#### February:

[pecl/http](http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http) with support for persistent
handles has been released.

A [proposal of mine at internals](http://marc.info/?l=php-dev&m=117188035610011&w=2) 
to change the behaviour of read_property/write_property and get_property_ptr_ptr object handlers has
successfully been ignored.

The idea was the following:

> Wouldn't it be reasonable for the engine to use get_property_ptr_ptr()
whenever it wants to modify a property and get rid of using read_property()
for write access?  
> That would make rather simple ops like concatenation, in-/decrementation etc
work again with overloaded internal classes. Just make the engine use
read_property() followed by a write_property() when there's no
get_property_ptr_ptr().


Nobody was interested.

#### March:

I [added a comparison object handler](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/date/php_date.c?r1=1.131&r2=1.132&diff_format=u) 
to the DateTime class, which means that comparisons of DateTime objects should work in recent
PHP5 versions.

I started development of pecl/libetpan, but [dropped it again](http://marc.info/?l=pecl-dev&m=117464452600994&w=2) 
because of pretty huge differences between how the library works and how PHP is supposed to
work. What a pity.

A less fine guy, some Omid, wanted me to write a PHP extension which
calculates the strength of "poker hands", but he jumped off when I had done
the algos.

#### April:

A fine guy, pretending his name was Andreas Weber, noticed that pecl/http's
request method implementation was completely b0rked. Thanks to his report it
was fixed in 1.5.3.

All fame Lukas Smith, queried me about what might have changed with my new
output layer implementation for PHP6, but I noticed too late that it's been
for a conference talk he was preparing, so I feel like I didn't spend enough
attention to his questions. Sorry Lukas.

I started to implement [libcurl's](http://curl.haxx.se) new multi_socket AKA
hiper API in conjunction with [libevent](http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/),
but stumbled across a few
[problem](http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-04/0308.html)s.

#### May:

My journey with libcurl's multi_socket API
[continues](http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-05/0125.html), which eventually
causes the delay of a first pecl/http 1.6 release candidate.

I [tried](http://dev.iworks.at) [Drupal](http://drupal.org) for the first
time.

Well, that'd be it. If it reads like an extrusion of junk, it probably was. ;)
