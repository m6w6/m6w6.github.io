[Jan](http://janschneider.de/cweb/home/index,channel,25,story,175.html)
reported that Chora is already fixed for three months.


First of all, let me apologize, I didn't want to hurt
[Horde](http://horde.org) or anyone else, and if you found my posting
confusing, then well, I was confused and not too little...

That weekend my server has been cracked again, and ctorrent has been installed
to burn my traffic (from the same network 210.5.125.*).

I doubt that the
[announcement](http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2004/000100.html) Jan
posted helped much, because how comes that apparently every script-kiddy knew
about the vulnaribility but not chora users (at least I didn't know, and I saw
a lot of chora 1.2 installations out there).

If I would have found a note on [Chora's homepage](http://www.horde.org/chora/), 
I think, I wouldn't have posted such a panic reaction.

So, sorry once again and I hope that this was - at least - a lesson to
everyone of us...
