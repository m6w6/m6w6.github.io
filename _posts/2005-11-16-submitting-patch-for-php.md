If you once have that odd feeling that something in PHP is missing and you're
brave enough to write something up (a patch) that would change that situation
in your eyes, don't expect such a submission will make it into old branches.

Questions to include new features in PHP-4 or PHP-5.0 will most probably be
declined (for a good reason), so the chance that the invested time is wasted
time is rather high.

If you still feel confident about your addition, write the patch against the
CVS HEAD or at least 5.1 branch, but for PHP-5.1 which is 
[around the corner](../../2005-11-13/php-51-around-the-corner/)
the probability for acceptance of new features has decreased a lot (or rather
completely).

On the other hand, if your patch is trying to fix a
[bug](http://bugs.php.net), don't hesitate to provide a patch for **every
single** CVS branch ;)
