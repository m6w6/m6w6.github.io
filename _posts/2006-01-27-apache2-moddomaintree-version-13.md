I just released
[mod_domaintree](http://freshmeat.net/projects/mod_domaintree/)-1.3 on
[freshmeat](http://freahmeat.net).

It'll take some time to appear, though.

The code has been cleaned up a lot and a host name to directory cache (per
server/process) has been added.

Enable the cache by setting DomainTreeCache to a reasonable high number, like
the amount of different domains being hosted.

Drop me a [mail](mailto:mike@iworks.at) if you like it! ;)
