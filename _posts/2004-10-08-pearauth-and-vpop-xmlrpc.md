You guessed, I've written a [vpop-xmlrpc container](http://dev.iworks.at/vpop-xmlrpc/VPOPXMLRPC.phps) 
for [PEAR::Auth](http://pear.php.net/package/Auth).

There's also a [new version](http://dev.iworks.at/vpop-xmlrpc/vpop-xmlrpc-1.1.tar.gz) 
of the vpop-xmlrpc cgi, which is needed for the Auth
container, because the method **vpop.auth** has recently been added.

Have fun ;)
