Recent [discussions](http://marc.info/?t=117857313600047&r=1&w=2) about
inclusion of [pecl/phar](http://pecl.php.net/package/phar) into the core
distribution shows again that we are missing a defined process of handling
additions to the PHP main distibution. How many people are really reading
through all mails of 100+ message threads?

It's going to be a chaos. Always. Once a developer has got his new, shiny and
soon-to-be-world-dominating extension into the core, he'll be a even stronger
advocator of the "no-new-extensions" camp. Not to disrespect any work, but
this is pure rivalism, masculine--really!

The idea of moving extensions from core to pecl is honorous, but we all know
the current problems of this ideology.

Many people have asked me when
[pecl/http](http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http) will be included in the
main distribution. My answer is short and simple: "Never" (I usually add a
tiny sentence, but that's nothing encouraging either).

Ah... and please do me a favour: rather keep your comments to yourself :)
(...or toss it into the nonsense thread@internals).
